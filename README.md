TFS
===

This is Powershell module to communicate with [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx) 2015 via its [REST interface](https://www.visualstudio.com/integrate/get-started/rest/basics). It provides commands which allow you to create, update, export and import build definitions, get build logs, projects, repositories etc. The goal of the module is to be able to automate TFS setup and put its configuration on the project repository.

The module is tested with Team Foundation Server Update 2.

Installation
============

On Windows 10 or Powershell 5+ use: `Install-Module TFS`. 

To install manually, copy the module to the one of the directories listed in `$Env:PSModulePath`.

Configuration
=============

Module uses global variable `$tfs` for its configuration:

    $global:tfs = @{
        root_url    = 'http://tfs015:8080/tfs'
        collection  = 'DefaultCollection'
        project     = 'ProjectXYZ'
    }

Some attributes will take defaults if you don't specify them:

    $tfs.collection  = 'DefaultCollection'
    $tfs.api_version = '2.0'

If you need to work constantly on a single project put this setting in your `$PROFILE`. To manage multiple projects or collections or TFS servers you could create multiple functions for each scenario that each set `$global:tfs` in its own way, for example:

    function set_tfs_test() {
        $global:tfs = @{ ... }
    }

Then, prior to calling any module function run `set_tfs_test`.

TFS Credentials
---------------

Module keeps TFS credential in the `$tfs.Credentials`. If not specified you will be prompted for the credentials when running any of the functions. If the module [CredentialManager](https://github.com/davotronic5000/PowerShell_Credential_Manager) is available (to install it run `Install-Module CredentialManager` in Powreshell 5+) credentials will be stored in the Windows Credential Manager and after first run, you will be able to use any function in any PS session using your stored credentials.

To use _ad hoc_ credentials when you have your main credential stored simply use: 
    
    $tfs.Credentials = Get-Credential

This way stored credentials will be overridden only for the current session. To change the stored credentials for all subsequent sessions either delete them using the Control Panel (Manage Windows Credentials) and run any function again or use the following command:

    $tfs.Credentials = New-TFSCredential    #Get credential and store it in Credential Manager.

Usage
=====

* To view all supported commands execute `gcm -m tfs` 
* To get all aliases execute `get-alias | ? source -eq 'tfs'`
* Use `man` to get help for the command: `man builds -Example`

All functions have a `Verbose` parameter that shows very detailed log of every step involved:

    PS> Get-TFSBuildLogs -Verbose
